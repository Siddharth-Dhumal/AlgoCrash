# Sprint 1 â€“ Stand-Up Meeting Notes

This document includes each team member's answers to the three Scrum questions for four days of stand-up meetings. It is written in a rough, informal format as instructed.

## ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Monday

**Siddharth Dhumal**  
1. Looked at some Qt UI examples and the basic signal-slot system.  
2. Iâ€™m going to test simple button setup and see how it connects.  
3. Nothing blocking right now.

**Devin Gupta**  
1. I installed Box2D and started reading the integration guide.  
2. I plan to link Box2D with our Qt setup and test a small sample.  
3. Might need help with CMake configuration for both libraries.

**Abdulrahman Al Hattali**  
1. I went through Box2D tutorials.  
2. Iâ€™ll begin setting up the rendering part in Qt.  
3. I need to understand how to pass Box2D object data to Qt graphics.

**Jungbin Moon**  
1. Looked into Box2Dâ€™s body and shape classes.  
2. Iâ€™ll work on setting up the ground block.  
3. No blockers, but I want to double-check scaling ratios.

**Yen Yee Tan**  
1. Read about basic UI elements in Qt.  
2. I will try adding a button for running the animation.  
3. No blockers for now.

## ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ Tuesday

**Abdulrahman Al Hattali**  
1. Qt project is building properly.  
2. Iâ€™ll add placeholder code for a Box2D block.  
3. Trying to match coordinate systems between Qt and Box2D.

**Devin Gupta**  
1. Box2D compiles but not linked yet.  
2. Will work on linking and testing with a simple Box2D body.  
3. Might need help setting library paths on macOS.

**Siddharth Dhumal**  
1. Tried out button connections and added a basic click response.  
2. Planning to help test the pause/start functionality once itâ€™s hooked up.  
3. No blockers, just learning more about how Qt handles signals.

**Jungbin Moon**  
1. Wrote basic Box2D ground setup.  
2. Iâ€™ll try to make a block land and stop on it.  
3. None.

**Yen Yee Tan**  
1. Added a test button to the window.  
2. Will hook it up to start/stop logic soon.  
3. Just need to decide on signal-slot connection style.

## ðŸ“… Day 3 â€“ Wednesday

**Abdulrahman Al Hattali**  
1. Added one falling block into the world.  
2. I want to fine-tune gravity and bouncing.  
3. Rendering delay is a bit off â€” might ask Siddharth.

**Devin Gupta**  
1. Box2D integration is finally working!  
2. Iâ€™ll test more shapes today and see how many we can support.  
3. None for now.

**Siddharth Dhumal**  
1. Helped test the start button and added a basic tooltip message.  
2. Will try adding one more tooltip type for block interactions.  
3. Slight delay in tooltip timing but not a big issue.

**Jungbin Moon**  
1. Ground works and is detecting collisions.  
2. Iâ€™ll try to test with multiple falling objects.  
3. I might slow it down a bit â€” it falls too fast.

**Yen Yee Tan**  
1. Hooked up button to start/stop the simulation.  
2. Next, Iâ€™ll try to pause mid-simulation.  
3. No blockers so far.

## ðŸ“… Day 4 â€“ Thursday

**Abdulrahman Al Hattali**  
1. Finalized block creation and bounce effect.  
2. Will clean up and comment the code.  
3. None.

**Devin Gupta**  
1. Tested with more blocks and added slight random spawn offset.  
2. Iâ€™ll wrap up by helping with documentation.  
3. No blockers now.

**Siddharth Dhumal**  
1. Finalized tooltips and tested the start/pause buttons.  
2. Will help update documentation if needed.  
3. Everything seems to be working fine now.

**Jungbin Moon**  
1. Final ground test looks good.  
2. Will prepare a basic screenshot for our UI mockup.  
3. None.

**Yen Yee Tan**  
1. Pause button works now.  
2. Iâ€™ll make a second button to reset the world.  
3. None.

## ðŸš€ Sprint Review & Retrospective

### ðŸ§© Sprint Review (What We Got Done)

- Box2D was successfully integrated into the project.  
- We managed to simulate falling blocks that bounce on the ground.  
- UI buttons were added to start, stop, and pause the simulation.  
- The simulation logic and visuals are connected, with visible animation.  
- We created a tooltip placeholder to explain block collisions.  

### ðŸ’¬ Retrospective (Team Reflections)

- Communication was consistent, and everyone showed up for meetings.  
- We split tasks well and everyone contributed to core features.  
- A few delays came from setting up libraries and understanding Qt-Box2D connection.  
- Some people were learning new tools (Box2D, Qt), which slowed things slightly.  
- For Sprint 2, we want to:  
  - Start a bit earlier  
  - Test in smaller chunks more often  
  - Possibly pair up for UI + physics syncing  

Overall, we were happy with our progress and feel ready for more complex logic in Sprint 2.
