# AlgoCrash – Project Backlog

This document contains our initial set of user stories that define the primary features of our project. Each story is written from the user’s perspective to highlight the value each feature provides. These stories will guide our development over the coming sprints.

| User Story                                                                                                  | Priority | Notes                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| As a student, I want to choose a specific algorithm to run, so I can visually understand how it works.      | High     | This covers selection of BubbleSort, QuickSort, etc.       |
| As a learner, I want to see blocks or objects moving on screen to represent the algorithm steps.            | High     | Physics-based visuals help explain sorting/traversal steps.|
| As a player, I want the blocks to bounce or interact when comparisons or swaps happen, so I can grasp the logic physically. | High     | This is crucial to deliver the “interactive” part.          |
| As a user, I want to read simple on-screen explanations during the simulation, so I can follow along easily.| High     | Text boxes or tooltips will explain each step in context.  |
| As a student, I want to control the speed or pause the simulation, so I can learn at my own pace.           | Medium   | Allows users to step through and repeat steps if needed.   |
| As a player, I want to input or customize my dataset before starting, so I can experiment with different cases. | Medium   | This promotes hands-on exploration and understanding.       |
| As a user, I want to reset or switch to a different algorithm mid-session, so I can compare behaviors easily.| Medium   | Important for exploring how algorithms differ visually.    |
| As a developer, I want to include a mock UI layout, so the team can better visualize the design.            | Low      | Helpful for aligning front-end and animation planning.     |
